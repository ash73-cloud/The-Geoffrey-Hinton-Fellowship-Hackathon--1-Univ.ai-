# The-Geoffrey-Hinton-Fellowship-Hackathon--1-Univ.ai-
An organization wants to predict who possible defaulters are for the consumer loans product. 
They have data about historic customer behavior based on what they have observed. 
Hence when they acquire new customers they want to predict who is more risky and who is not.
Evaluations are on the basis of roc_auc_score.
